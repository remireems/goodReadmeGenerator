# goodReadmeGenerator

This is a command-line README generator app that uses inquirer npm and javascript. This application will help users easily create a professional README file for their projects. When the js file is opened, the user will open terminal to install the inquirer npm. Next, type in "node index.js" and hit enter to start the generator. The generator will prompt several questions for the user to fill out for their README. After answering all the questions, the generator will create a new README file for the user. For the editorial inputs, type "i" to insert and begin typing in information. To exit out of the editor, press esc btn and type ":wq". Check out the example README file, [README1.md](https://github.com/remireems/goodReadmeGenerator/blob/main/README1.md).
